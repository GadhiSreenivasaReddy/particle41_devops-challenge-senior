The instructions provided outline two methods for working with a Docker image:

1. **Pull the image from Docker Hub**:
   Run the following command to directly pull the pre-built image:
   ```
   docker pull gadhisreenivasareddy/simpletimeservice:v1
   ```

2. **Build the image locally**:
   Use the following steps:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```
   - Navigate into the directory:
     ```
     cd ./app
     ```
   - Build the Docker image locally with a chosen name and tag:
     ```
     docker build -t <imageName:tag> .
     ```

This approach is useful if you want to customize the Docker image or inspect its contents.
